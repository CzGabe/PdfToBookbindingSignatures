Updated for my like using pypdf.
Ready to create signatures for 
- front-and-back printing with selected number of papers per signature
- creating 2 sided signature ("booklets") on A3 landscape page in 1 new pdf (good for A4 printing)
- Can add extra margin to the middle (between 2 pages) - useful for binding
Note: I found AcrobatReader adds additional margins that messes up the layout at print... I got around this using something else to print (and testing the 1st signature)
