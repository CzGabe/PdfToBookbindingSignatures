This is a Python thing I made while learning how to code stuff, so it may be terrible.

Now with super basic GUI in the gui one, some basic error handling (probably implemented wrong) and bugs!

Uses PyPDF2

There is a .exe that you can download in the "/dist/" folder, if you feel like trusting .exe files from the internet

The .exe is built from pdftobookbindingsignaturesGUI.py with pyInstaller -F
